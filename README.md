A React-based, fully responsive, cart SPA that fetches API data and presents them to the user, allowing them to preview & 'order' items.

This project was a lovely opporunity to experiment with a medium-sized SPA that fetches the data it operates on. Additionally, it implements a loading fallback, thanks to React Content Loader and Suspense, and is based on JavaScript, Redux Toolkit and Styled Components. For a detailed overview, please have a look at the [**Features**](#features) & [**Tech**](#tech) section.
